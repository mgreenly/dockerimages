# Docker doesn't allow build contexts to include directories
# outside the current working directory.  So this script sym
# links the current users $HOME/.debian-cabal directory into
# the working directory if necessary and then mounts that
# directory as /home/haskell/.cabal inside the container
#
# This allows cabal to reuse compiled packages between projects
# like it normally would when it's not run in a container

# if [[ ! -e $HOME/.debian-ruby ]]; then
#   mkdir $HOME/.debian-ruby
# fi

if [[ ! -d .debian-ruby ]]; then
  # ln -s $HOME/.debian-ruby $PWD/.debian-ruby
  mkdir .debian-ruby
fi

# docker pull mgreenly/ruby

#
# all arguments given to this script are passed to cabal running in the container
#
exec docker run --rm -i -t \
  -u $(id -u):$(id -g) \

  -v $PWD:/workdir  \
