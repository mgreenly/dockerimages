# docker-jekyll 

For what ever reason I've found jekyll to have more installation dependency problems than most gems.

So I decided to dockerize it to make it immune to changes in my system.

Not to mention it means I get to create something called **docker-jekyll**  =)

## installation

Copy the ./bin/docker-jekyll script to $HOME/.local/bin or some where else on your path
