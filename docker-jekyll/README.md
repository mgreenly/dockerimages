# docker-jekyll 

For what ever reason I've found jekyll to have more installation dependency problems than most gems.
Since it seems I rarely update my blog and there fore rarely use jekyll I figured I'd just containerize it.
That way it doesn't matter if my operatins system or ruby installation changes it should still work.

Not to mention it means I get to create something called **docker-jekyll**

## installation

Copy the ./bin/docker-jekyll script to $HOME/.local/bin or some where else on your path
